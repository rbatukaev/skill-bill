# Shared Code Review Orchestrator Snapshot

This maintainer-facing reference snapshot documents the shared review-orchestration contract used when authoring or updating installable skills.

Runtime-facing skills consume this contract through sibling supporting files such as `review-orchestrator.md` inside each skill directory. Do not reference this repo-relative path directly from installable skills.

## Shared Contract For Every Specialist

- Review only changed code in the current PR or unit of work
- Surface only meaningful issues such as bugs, logic flaws, security risks, regression risks, or architectural breakage
- Flag newly introduced deprecated APIs or patterns when a supported alternative exists, or when deprecated usage is broad and unjustified
- Ignore style-only nits, formatting preferences, and naming bikeshedding
- Evidence is mandatory: include `file:line` and a short description
- Severity: `Blocker | Major | Minor`
- Confidence: `High | Medium | Low`
- Keep each specialist review pass to at most 7 findings
- Include a minimal concrete fix for each finding

## Shared Scope Contract

- Resolve the exact review source before routing, classifying, or selecting specialist review passes
- Supported scope labels are `staged changes`, `unstaged changes`, `working tree`, `commit range`, `PR diff`, and `files`
- When the caller asks for staged changes, inspect only the staged/index diff and treat unstaged working tree edits as out of scope, except for repo markers needed for stack detection
- When the caller asks for unstaged changes, inspect only the unstaged working tree diff and do not fold in staged-only hunks unless the caller explicitly asks for all local changes
- Use `working tree` only when the caller explicitly wants both staged and unstaged local changes reviewed together
- State the resolved scope in Section 1 as `Detected review scope: ...`

## Shared Execution Mode Contract

- Review skills must choose an execution mode of `inline` or `delegated` before running routed review layers or specialist review passes
- `inline` is allowed only when the review scope is small and low-risk; treat a scope as inline-eligible only when all of the following are true:
  - one routed stack-specific review skill is sufficient
  - the diff contains at most 10 changed files and at most 400 changed lines (additions + deletions); if either threshold is exceeded, the diff is too large for inline
  - no mixed-stack or mixed KMP/backend layering requires multiple routed review layers
  - no high-risk signals dominate the diff, such as auth/security/secrets changes, public API or schema changes, persistence or migration changes, concurrency/lifecycle/threading changes, retries/timeouts/caching/observability changes, rollout/feature-flag changes, or broad config/infra changes
- If any inline-eligibility condition is false or unclear, choose `delegated`
- Inline mode must still run the selected baseline or specialist review passes deliberately, using each reviewer's own rubric and the shared specialist contract; do not collapse the review into a generic skim

## Shared Learnings Context

- The top-level review caller owns learnings resolution for the current review context
- When applied learnings are already passed in by the caller, reuse them instead of re-resolving them independently in nested review layers
- For a top-level or standalone review, resolve active learnings for the current repo and routed review skill before running the review when a local learnings resolver is available
- Apply only active learnings; do not use disabled learnings as review context
- Prefer more specific scopes in this order: `skill`, `repo`, `global`
- Treat learnings as explicit context, not as hidden suppression rules; do not let them override evidence-based correctness, security, or contract findings
- If no learnings were passed in and no local resolver is available, report `Applied learnings: none` instead of inventing hidden context
- Pass the applied learnings forward to delegated or layered review passes when the current review routes additional workers

## Shared Delegation Contract

- Runtime-facing review skills must read `review-delegation.md` before delegating routed review layers or specialist review passes
- When execution mode is `delegated`, routed review layers and specialist review passes run as separate subagents on supported runtimes
- If delegated review is required for the current scope and a supported runtime cannot start the required workers, stop and report that delegated review is required for this scope but unavailable on the current runtime
- If a specialist review pass fails or returns no output, note it in the summary and continue with available results when the parent skill contract permits it
- When multiple review passes produce overlapping findings, deduplicate by root cause and keep the highest severity/confidence version
- Prioritize final findings as `Blocker > Major > Minor`, then by blast radius

## Shared Report Structure

Section 1 summary must include `Review session ID: <review-session-id>`.
Section 1 summary must include `Review run ID: <review-run-id>`.
Section 1 summary must include `Detected review scope: <staged changes / unstaged changes / working tree / commit range / PR diff / files>`.
Section 1 summary must include `Execution mode: inline | delegated`.
Section 1 summary must include `Applied learnings: none | <learning references>`.

Generate one review session id per top-level review using the format `rvs-<uuid4>` (e.g. `rvs-550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`). If a parent reviewer already passed a `review_session_id` into a delegated or layered review, reuse it instead of generating a new one. Reuse that same session id across the summary, follow-up telemetry, and any learnings-resolution workflow for the current review lifecycle.

Generate one review run id per concrete review output using the format `rvw-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-XXXX` where `XXXX` is a random 4-character alphanumeric suffix for uniqueness (e.g. `rvw-20260405-143022-b2e1`). If a parent reviewer already passed a `review_run_id` into a delegated or layered review, reuse it instead of generating a new one. Reuse that same run id across the summary, the risk register, and any follow-up feedback workflow for the current review output.

After Section 1 in a stack-specific review skill, use:

- `### 2. Risk Register`
- `### 3. Action Items (Max 10, prioritized)`
- `### 4. Verdict`

Every finding in `### 2. Risk Register` must use this exact machine-readable bullet format:

```text
- [F-001] <Severity> | <Confidence> | <file:line> | <description>
```

Do NOT use markdown tables, numbered lists, or any other format for findings. The bullet format above is required for downstream tooling (triage, telemetry, stats) to parse findings correctly.

- Severity must be one of: `Blocker`, `Major`, `Minor`
- Confidence must be one of: `High`, `Medium`, `Low`
- Finding ids must be unique within the current review run and stable enough for follow-up feedback or fix requests in the same workflow
- Assign finding ids sequentially in risk-register order using `F-001`, `F-002`, `F-003`, and so on

## Auto-Import

After producing the final review output, automatically import it into the local telemetry store so the review run and findings are recorded without manual intervention.

Call the `import_review` MCP tool:
- `review_text`: the complete review output (Section 1 through Section 4)

## Auto-Triage

After the user responds to the review findings and the agent has acted on each decision (applied fixes, skipped findings, etc.), record the triage decisions so the review lifecycle can complete and the finished telemetry event can fire.

Each finding gets one decision using its position number from the risk register:
- `fix` — the finding was accepted and the fix was applied
- `accept` — the finding was accepted but no code change was needed
- `skip` — the finding was intentionally skipped (append a reason after ` - `)
- `false_positive` — the finding was incorrect

Call the `triage_findings` MCP tool:
- `review_run_id`: the review run ID from the review output
- `decisions`: prefer a single structured selection string that fully resolves the review, e.g. `["fix=[1,3] reject=[2]"]`
- fallback: explicit numbered decisions still work, e.g. `["1 fix", "2 skip - intentional", "3 accept"]`

Skip auto-triage when the review produced no findings.

## Specialist Contract Subset

Delegated specialist subagents receive `specialist-contract.md` instead of this full file. That file contains only "Shared Contract For Every Specialist" and "Shared Report Structure" — the two sections specialists need. Orchestrator-only sections (Scope, Execution Mode, Learnings, Delegation) are omitted to reduce per-subagent token cost. Keep `specialist-contract.md` in sync when updating those two sections.
