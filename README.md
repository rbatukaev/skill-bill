# sKill Bill

sKill Bill is a portable AI skill suite for code review, feature implementation, and developer tooling. It is strongest today for Kotlin, Android/KMP, Kotlin backend/server, PHP backends, Go backends/services, and agent-config repositories.

This repo is a collection of 44 AI skills installed into your coding agents from one source of truth. The goal is simple: keep high-value skills reusable across agents while preventing the skill catalog from turning into a pile of random prompts.

## Why this exists

Most prompt or skill repos degrade over time:

- names drift
- overlapping skills appear
- stack-specific behavior leaks into generic prompts
- different agents get different copies

sKill Bill treats skills more like software:

- stable base capabilities
- platform-specific overrides
- shared routing logic
- CI-enforced naming and structure
- one repo synced to every supported agent

## Core model

The repo is organized around a strict three-layer model:

- `skills/base/` — canonical, user-facing capabilities such as `bill-code-review`, `bill-quality-check`, and `bill-feature-implement`
- `skills/<platform>/` — platform-specific overrides and approved subskills
- `orchestration/` — maintainer-facing reference snapshots for shared routing and review contracts

Think of it as markdown with inheritance:

- base skills define the stable contracts
- platform skills specialize them
- orchestration snapshots document the shared logic that runtime-facing skills can reference via sibling supporting files in the same skill directory

Current platform packages:

- `kotlin`
- `backend-kotlin`
- `kmp`
- `php`
- `go`

## Naming and enforcement

Naming is intentionally strict:

- base skills may use any neutral `bill-<capability>` name
- platform overrides must use `bill-<platform>-<base-capability>`
- deeper specialization is only allowed for code review:
  - `bill-<platform>-code-review-<area>`

Approved `code-review` areas:

- `architecture`
- `performance`
- `platform-correctness`
- `security`
- `testing`
- `api-contracts`
- `persistence`
- `reliability`
- `ui`
- `ux-accessibility`

That means new stacks can extend the system, but they cannot invent random new naming shapes without intentionally updating the validator and docs.

## Routing model

Base entry points stay stable for users:

- `/bill-code-review`
- `/bill-quality-check`
- `/bill-feature-implement`

They route internally to platform-specific skills:

- `bill-code-review` -> `bill-kotlin-code-review` | `bill-backend-kotlin-code-review` | `bill-kmp-code-review` | `bill-php-code-review` | `bill-go-code-review`
- `bill-quality-check` -> current stack-specific quality checker, including `bill-php-quality-check` for PHP repos and `bill-go-quality-check` for Go repos

Today, `backend-kotlin` and `kmp` both fall back to `bill-kotlin-quality-check` until dedicated overrides exist.

## Supported agents

| Agent | Install path |
|-------|--------------|
| GitHub Copilot | `~/.copilot/skills/` |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/commands/` |
| GLM | `~/.glm/commands/` |
| OpenAI Codex | `~/.codex/skills/` or `~/.agents/skills/` |

The installer links all selected agents to the same repo so updates stay in sync. Runtime-facing skills reference supporting files that live beside `SKILL.md` inside each skill directory rather than depending on repo-relative playbook paths.

## Installation

```bash
git clone <this-repo> ~/Development/skill-bill
cd ~/Development/skill-bill
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The installer first asks which agent targets to install to. You can choose one or more entries, including `all`:

```text
all
```

It then shows the available platform packages and asks which ones to install. Base skills in `skills/base/` are always installed; platform packages are installed only when selected.

Available options are shown as separate entries:

```text
Kotlin backend
Kotlin
KMP
PHP
Go
all
```

Example platform selections:

```text
Kotlin backend, Kotlin, KMP
PHP
Go
all
```

Each installer run replaces the existing Skill Bill links and reinstalls only the agent and platform selections from that run.

Shared routing and review contracts are documented in `orchestration/` and exposed to runtimes through sibling supporting files inside each skill directory. That keeps references local to the installed skill instead of relying on repo-relative playbook paths.

The installer always removes existing Skill Bill links before reinstalling the selected agents and platforms.

If you only use Claude Code, you can also install this repo as a Claude plugin:

```bash
claude plugin install ~/Development/skill-bill
```

## Uninstallation

To remove Skill Bill skill symlinks from the supported agent install paths:

```bash
chmod +x uninstall.sh
./uninstall.sh
```

The uninstaller is idempotent. It removes current Skill Bill skill names plus known legacy install names when they are present as symlinks, and skips non-symlink paths.

## Project customization

Use `AGENTS.md` for repo-wide guidance.

Use `.agents/skill-overrides.md` for per-skill customization without editing this plugin. The file is intentionally strict:

- first line must be `# Skill Overrides`
- each section must be `## <existing-skill-name>`
- each section body must be a bullet list
- freeform text outside sections is invalid

Precedence:

1. matching `.agents/skill-overrides.md` section
2. `AGENTS.md`
3. built-in skill defaults

Example:

```md
# Skill Overrides

## bill-kotlin-quality-check
- Treat warnings as blocking work.

## bill-pr-description
- Keep QA steps concise.
```

## Validation

This repo validates both content quality and taxonomy rules.

Local checks:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
npx --yes agnix --strict .
python3 scripts/validate_agent_configs.py
```

CI runs the same checks.

The validator enforces:

- package location rules
- naming rules
- README catalog drift
- cross-skill references
- required routing playbook references
- plugin metadata

## Adding skills

Preferred path:

- run `/bill-new-skill-all-agents`

Manual path:

1. create `skills/<package>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
2. follow the naming rules above
3. run `./install.sh`
4. update docs and validation if you intentionally add a new package or naming shape
