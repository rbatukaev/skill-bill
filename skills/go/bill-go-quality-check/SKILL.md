name: bill-go-quality-check
description: Run the project's canonical quality-check command(s) and systematically fix all issues without using suppressions. Use when running repo-defined checks, tests, linting, static analysis, formatting, or security validation in Go projects. Fixes issues properly at the root cause instead of suppressing them. Use when user mentions run Go checks, go vet, golangci-lint, go test, or fix Go lint issues.

# Go Quality Check

This is the current Go implementation behind the shared `bill-quality-check` router. Invoke it directly only when you
already know the repo should use the Go quality-check path.

Execute the project's quality-check flow and systematically fix issues **only in files changed in the current unit of
work**. Ignore pre-existing issues in untouched files unless the change clearly exposes them.

## Execution Steps

1. **Determine changed files**: Use `git diff --name-only` (against the base branch or HEAD) to identify files changed in the current unit of work
2. **Run initial check**: Execute the project's quality-check commands and capture complete output
3. **Filter to changed files**: From the check output, only address issues in files from step 1 — skip everything else
4. **Categorize issues**: Group by type (module/build hygiene, formatting, lint errors, static analysis, vet findings, race failures, test failures, security/audit failures, etc.)
5. **Fix systematically**: For each issue category in priority order:
   - Mark todo as in_progress
   - Read affected files
   - Implement proper fixes (never suppress)
   - Mark todo as completed
6. **Verify fixes**: Re-run the quality-check command(s) after all fixes
7. **Iterate if needed**: If new issues appear, repeat the process

## Fix Strategy

**Always Fix, Never Suppress:**
- Never add suppressions, baseline entries, or ignore rules as the default fix
- Never add `// TODO` or `// FIXME` comments to defer issues
- Never skip required project scripts silently
- Implement proper solutions that address the root cause
- Refactor code to eliminate warnings
- Add missing tests or fix failing ones

**Priority Order:**
0. Module, generated-code, and build-constraint hygiene (`go mod tidy`, repo generation commands, build tags / platform files) when present
1. Formatting and import hygiene (`gofmt`, `go fmt`, `goimports`) when present
2. Lint / style issues (`golangci-lint`, project lint wrappers)
3. Static analysis / vet issues (`go vet`, `staticcheck`, compiler/type errors)
4. Test failures (`go test`, targeted package tests, example tests)
5. Race / concurrency validation failures (`go test -race`) when the repo expects it
6. Security or dependency audit failures (`govulncheck`, `gosec`, project wrappers)

**Structural Fixes (Priority 0):**

These issues often create cascading failures and should be fixed before lint/test cleanup:

- **`go.mod` / `go.sum` drift**:
  - Run `go mod tidy` or the repo's wrapper to restore the intended dependency graph
  - Verify the resulting module changes are expected and not accidental dependency upgrades

- **Generated code or schema drift**:
  - Re-run the repo's generation command when protobuf, sqlc, mock, stringer, or other generated artifacts are expected
  - Do not hand-edit generated files unless the repo explicitly requires it

- **Build constraints / platform-specific file selection**:
  - Verify `//go:build`, legacy build tags, and `_unix.go` / `_linux.go`-style suffixes still include the file on the intended targets
  - Use the repo's wrapper or `go list`-style inspection when tag selection is unclear

**When to Ask User:**
- Architectural decisions (e.g., choosing between dependency shapes)
- Breaking API changes that affect multiple packages or services
- Test failures where business logic is unclear
- Security-related issues requiring policy decisions
- When multiple valid fix approaches exist with trade-offs

## Project Overrides

If `.agents/skill-overrides.md` exists in the project root and contains a `## bill-go-quality-check` section, read
that section and apply it as the highest-priority instruction for this skill. The matching section may refine or replace
parts of the default workflow below.

If an `AGENTS.md` file exists in the project root, apply it as project-wide guidance.

Precedence for this skill: matching `.agents/skill-overrides.md` section > `AGENTS.md` > built-in defaults.

## Go-Specific Guidance

- Prefer the project's wrapper command (`make`, `mage`, `task`, scripts, etc.) over bare tools when one exists
- Go formatting is non-negotiable: use `gofmt` or `go fmt` and import cleanup with `goimports` when the repo expects it
- In Go-first repos, common quality commands may include `go test ./...`, `go test -race ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `golangci-lint run`, `staticcheck ./...`, `govulncheck ./...`, or project wrappers around them
- Keep generated artifacts, module metadata, and build tags in sync before trusting downstream lint or test failures
- Run package-scoped commands when that preserves signal and reduces churn, but use repo-defined aggregate commands when the project expects them
- If the repo uses goleak, leaktest, example tests, or other goroutine/example validation, treat those failures as first-class quality issues rather than optional extras
- Fix the underlying issue rather than weakening lint, vet, race, or test coverage
- If a required command cannot be run, report that explicitly with the reason

## Output Format

Provide clear progress updates:
- Show issue count by category
- Report each fix with file path and line number
- Display the final quality-check result
- Summarize all changes made
- If a required command could not be run, report that explicitly with the reason
