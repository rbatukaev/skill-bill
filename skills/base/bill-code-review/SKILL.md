# Shared Code Review Router

Use this as the neutral review entry point for feature workflows and standalone reviews.

Keep this skill thin:
- detect the dominant stack in the review scope
- choose the matching stack-specific code-review skill
- pass through the same scope and relevant context
- do not duplicate stack-specific review heuristics here

## Project Overrides

If `.agents/skill-overrides.md` exists in the project root and contains a `## bill-code-review` section, read that section and apply it as the highest-priority instruction for this skill. The matching section may refine or replace parts of the default workflow below.

If an `AGENTS.md` file exists in the project root, apply it as project-wide guidance.

Precedence for this skill: matching `.agents/skill-overrides.md` section > `AGENTS.md` > built-in defaults.

## Setup

Determine the review scope:
- Specific files (list paths)
- Git commits (hashes/range)
- Staged changes (`git diff --cached`; index only)
- Unstaged changes (`git diff`; working tree only)
- Combined working tree (`git diff --cached` + `git diff`) only when the caller explicitly asks for all local changes
- Entire PR

Inspect both the changed files and repo markers before routing.

Resolve the scope before routing. If the caller asks for staged changes, route and review only the staged diff; do not let unstaged edits expand the findings beyond repo-marker stack detection.

## Additional Resources

- For shared stack-routing signals and tie-breakers, see [stack-routing.md](stack-routing.md).
- For agent-specific delegated review execution, see [review-delegation.md](review-delegation.md).

## Shared Stack Detection

Before routing, read [stack-routing.md](stack-routing.md). Use it as the source of truth for:
- stack taxonomy
- signal collection order
- dominant-stack tie-breakers
- mixed-stack routing rules

This supporting file lives beside `SKILL.md`; keep the routing rules in this skill aligned with it.

Do not redefine stack signals here unless a route-specific exception is truly unique to code review.

## Routing Rules

- If `kmp` signals dominate, delegate to `bill-kmp-code-review`.
- If `backend-kotlin` signals dominate, delegate to `bill-backend-kotlin-code-review`.
- If `kotlin` signals dominate without meaningful `kmp` or `backend-kotlin` markers, delegate to `bill-kotlin-code-review`.
- If `php` signals dominate, delegate to `bill-php-code-review`.
- If `go` signals dominate, delegate to `bill-go-code-review`.
- If the review scope mixes `kmp` with other Kotlin-family scope, prefer `bill-kmp-code-review` because it layers the appropriate Kotlin-family baseline internally instead of running multiple Kotlin-family orchestrators side by side.
- If the review scope mixes `backend-kotlin` with generic `kotlin` but not `kmp`, prefer `bill-backend-kotlin-code-review` because it layers `bill-kotlin-code-review` internally instead of running both side by side.
- If another supported stack dominates, delegate to that stack's canonical `bill-<stack>-code-review` skill when it exists in the available skill catalog.
- If multiple supported stacks appear in one review scope, route to each matching stack-specific skill and merge the results using delegated execution.
- If the required stack-specific skill does not exist yet, say so explicitly and stop instead of pretending coverage exists.
- The routed stack-specific skill is the source of truth for classification details, specialist selection, review heuristics, and single-stack execution mode.

## Execution Contract

Before running delegated routed reviews, read [review-delegation.md](review-delegation.md). Use it as the source of truth for agent-specific delegated execution of routed stack-specific review skills.

For a single routed stack-specific review skill:
- Let the routed stack-specific reviewer choose `inline` or `delegated` using its own `review-orchestrator.md` contract
- If the routed skill selects `inline`, run it inline in the current thread instead of spawning an extra routed worker just for indirection
- If the routed skill selects `delegated`, use `review-delegation.md` and pass along the routed skill file path plus the required review context

For multiple routed stack-specific review skills:
- Use delegated workers for each routed stack-specific review skill and merge the results in the parent review
- Use parallel delegated workers only when multiple supported stacks are clearly in scope
- If delegated review is required for the current scope and the runtime lacks a documented delegation path or cannot start the required worker(s), stop and report that delegated review is required for this scope but unavailable on the current runtime

When routing to another skill, pass along:
- the exact resolved review scope label
- the exact review scope
- the changed files or diff source
- the detected stack and key signals
- relevant `AGENTS.md` guidance and matching `.agents/skill-overrides.md` sections
- the parent thread's model when the runtime supports delegated-worker model inheritance
- the delegated skill file path
- the rule that the delegated skill must follow its own `SKILL.md` as the primary rubric
- the delegated skill's `review-orchestrator.md` contract when the routed skill is a stack review orchestrator

## Output Format

For a single routed skill:

```text
Routed to: <skill-name>
Detected review scope: <staged changes / unstaged changes / working tree / commit range / PR diff / files>
Detected stack: <stack>
Signals: <markers>
Execution mode: inline | delegated
Reason: <why this stack-specific reviewer was selected and why this execution mode was used>

<review output>
```

For multiple delegated skills:

```text
Routed to: <skill-a>, <skill-b>
Detected review scope: <staged changes / unstaged changes / working tree / commit range / PR diff / files>
Detected stack: Mixed
Signals: <markers>
Execution mode: delegated
Reason: <why multiple stack-specific reviewers were selected and why delegated routing was required>

<merged delegated review output>
```

For unsupported stacks:

```text
Detected review scope: <staged changes / unstaged changes / working tree / commit range / PR diff / files>
Detected stack: Unknown/Unsupported
Signals: <markers>
Result: No matching stack-specific code-review skill is available yet.
```
