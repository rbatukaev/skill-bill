description: Use when recording architectural or implementation decisions in a module/package/area agent/decisions.md file. Use when user mentions record decision, boundary decision, why we chose, decision log, or remember this decision.

# Boundary Decisions

## Project Overrides

If `.agents/skill-overrides.md` exists in the project root and contains a `## bill-boundary-decisions` section, read that section and apply it as the highest-priority instruction for this skill. The matching section may refine or replace parts of the default workflow below.

If an `AGENTS.md` file exists in the project root, apply it as project-wide guidance.

Precedence for this skill: matching `.agents/skill-overrides.md` section > `AGENTS.md` > built-in defaults.

## Purpose

Record **why** something was done a certain way — not what changed (that belongs in `history.md`), but the reasoning behind non-obvious choices, special cases, constraints, and trade-offs that future contributors need to understand before modifying the code.

## Inputs Required

- Decision title (short, descriptive)
- Primary module/package/area where the decision applies
- User explanation of the decision (the agent captures and structures it, not invents it)

## Input Recovery

- If the user omits the primary boundary, infer it from the files most recently changed in the current diff
- If the user gives a free-form explanation, the agent structures it into the entry format below — preserving the user's reasoning faithfully without adding interpretation

## Entry Format

```markdown
## [<date>] <short decision title>
Context: <what situation or requirement prompted this decision — 1-2 lines>
Decision: <what was chosen — 1-2 lines>
Reason: <why this approach over alternatives — 1-3 lines>
```

Optional trailing lines (include only when relevant):
- `Alternatives considered: <what was rejected and why — 1 line>`
- `Revisit when: <condition that would make this decision worth re-evaluating>`

## Format Rules

- Max **10 lines** per entry
- Newest entry first (reverse chronological)
- No code snippets; describe patterns and choices in plain language
- One decision per entry — if the user describes multiple decisions, write separate entries

## File Rules

- File path: `<primary-boundary>/agent/decisions.md`
- If the file does not exist, create it along with any missing parent directories
- Newest entry first
- No fixed entry cap
- Keep older entries when they still provide useful context for understanding the boundary's design
- Prune entries only when the decision has been fully reversed or the context no longer applies

## Distinguishing from History

- **history.md**: *what* changed, reusable patterns, feature scope — written after feature completion
- **decisions.md**: *why* something was done this way — written whenever the user wants to capture reasoning

If the user describes something that is purely a "what changed" summary with no reasoning, suggest `bill-boundary-history` instead.

## Output

Report one concise result:
- Written (with entry count) or skipped (with reason)
- Target file path
- Decision title(s) recorded
