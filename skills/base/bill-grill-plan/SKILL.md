# Grill Plan

Interview the user relentlessly about every aspect of their plan or design until reaching shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the decision tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one by one.

## Project Overrides

If `.agents/skill-overrides.md` exists in the project root and contains a `## bill-grill-plan` section, read that section and apply it as the highest-priority instruction for this skill. The matching section may refine or replace parts of the default workflow below.

If an `AGENTS.md` file exists in the project root, apply it as project-wide guidance.

Precedence for this skill: matching `.agents/skill-overrides.md` section > `AGENTS.md` > built-in defaults.

## Rules

- Ask questions **one at a time**
- For each question, provide your recommended answer
- If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore instead of asking
- Cover: edge cases, failure modes, scalability, backwards compatibility, rollback safety
- Challenge assumptions — don't accept "it should work" without evidence
- When all branches are resolved, summarize the final agreed design as a numbered list of decisions
