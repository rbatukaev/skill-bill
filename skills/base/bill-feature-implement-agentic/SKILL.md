name: bill-feature-implement-agentic
description: Experimental subagent-based variant of bill-feature-implement. Runs each heavy phase (pre-planning, planning, implementation, completeness audit, quality check, PR description) inside its own subagent with a rich self-contained briefing, to keep the orchestrator context small. Code review stays in the orchestrator because it already spawns specialist subagents internally. Use when you want the same end-to-end feature workflow but with less orchestrator context pollution.

# Feature Implement Agentic (experimental)

This is an experimental variant of `bill-feature-implement`. The workflow is the same end-to-end (spec → plan → implement → review → audit → validate → history → commit → PR), but the phases that do heavy reading or editing run inside dedicated subagents instead of in the orchestrator's own context.

If you want the established, non-subagent workflow, use `bill-feature-implement` instead. This skill is intentionally kept as a peer so both approaches can coexist.

## Project Overrides

If `.agents/skill-overrides.md` exists in the project root and contains a `## bill-feature-implement-agentic` section, read that section and apply it as the highest-priority instruction for this skill. The matching section may refine or replace parts of the default workflow below.

If an `AGENTS.md` file exists in the project root, apply it as project-wide guidance.

Precedence for this skill: matching `.agents/skill-overrides.md` section > `AGENTS.md` > built-in defaults. When you read another skill inline, also apply that skill's matching section from `.agents/skill-overrides.md` when present.

## Orchestrator vs subagent split

| Step | Where it runs | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Collect design doc + assess | **Orchestrator** | Requires user interaction |
| 1b — Create feature branch | **Orchestrator** | Trivial git op; keeps branch state visible |
| 2 — Pre-planning (history, spec save, patterns) | **Subagent** | Heavy reading; digest is small |
| 3 — Create implementation plan | **Subagent** | Heavy reading; returns structured plan |
| 4 — Execute plan | **Subagent** | Biggest context win; many file edits |
| 5 — Code review (`bill-code-review`) | **Orchestrator** | Already spawns specialist subagents internally — do not nest further |
| 6 — Completeness audit | **Subagent** | Re-reads code + criteria; returns pass/fail digest |
| 6b — Quality check (`bill-quality-check`) | **Subagent** | Shell-heavy; returns structured result + telemetry payload |
| 7 — Boundary history (`bill-boundary-history`) | **Orchestrator** | Small write, git-auditable |
| 8 — Commit and push | **Orchestrator** | Git ops must stay visible |
| 9 — PR description (`bill-pr-description`) | **Subagent** | Reads branch diff; returns PR URL + telemetry payload |

Subagents run **sequentially**, in the **same worktree** (no `isolation: "worktree"`). Do not launch any of these subagents in parallel.

Each subagent receives a **self-contained briefing** (see [reference.md](reference.md) for the per-phase briefing templates and structured return contracts). A subagent must not re-read the raw spec — it operates on what the orchestrator hands it. Its return value is a structured object the orchestrator can consume without re-parsing prose.

## Step 1: Collect Design Doc + Assess Size (orchestrator)

Ask the user for:
1. **Feature design doc** — inline text, file path, or directory of spec files
2. **Issue key** (e.g., `ME-5066`, `SKILL-10`) — **required**. The issue key prefixes the branch name, spec directory, and commit message. If the user has no issue yet, stop and ask them to create one before continuing; do not invent a placeholder.

Accept PDFs (read in page ranges if >10 pages), markdown, images. If a directory, read all files and synthesize. If spec exceeds ~8,000 words, ask which sections matter most.

### Single-Pass Assessment

Present everything together in one pass:
1. **Acceptance criteria** — numbered list
2. **Non-goals** — things explicitly out of scope
3. **Open questions** — unresolved decisions (if any)
4. **Feature size** — SMALL / MEDIUM / LARGE
5. **Feature name** inferred from spec
6. **Rollout need** — N/A unless spec/user/repo requires guarded rollout

Then ask: **Confirm or adjust the above before I plan.** Open questions must be resolved before proceeding. The confirmed criteria are the **contract** for the completeness audit and for every subagent briefing from Step 2 onward.

### Telemetry: Record Started

After the user confirms the assessment, call the `feature_implement_started` MCP tool with:
- `feature_size`, `acceptance_criteria_count`, `open_questions_count`
- `spec_input_types`: list of input types the user provided (`raw_text`, `pdf`, `markdown_file`, `image`, `directory`)
- `spec_word_count`: approximate word count of the design spec
- `rollout_needed`: whether a feature flag / guarded rollout is needed
- `feature_name`: the inferred feature name
- `issue_key`: the issue key the user provided (required — Step 1 does not proceed without it)
- `issue_key_type`: `jira`, `linear`, `github`, or `other`
- `spec_summary`: one sentence summarizing what the feature does

Save the returned `session_id` for `feature_implement_finished`. If the tool returns `status: skipped`, continue normally.

## Step 1b: Create Feature Branch (orchestrator)

`git checkout -b feat/{ISSUE_KEY}-{feature-name}`

## Step 2: Pre-Planning (subagent)

Spawn a subagent with the pre-planning briefing defined in [reference.md](reference.md) under "Pre-planning subagent briefing". The briefing includes: acceptance criteria, non-goals, issue key, feature name, spec content (or saved spec path for MEDIUM/LARGE), feature size, expected affected boundaries (if known), rollout need, and explicit instructions to:

- Read `agent/history.md` in each boundary the feature is likely to touch (newest first; stop when no longer relevant).
- Read `agent/decisions.md` header lines in each boundary and only open full entries when titles look relevant.
- For MEDIUM/LARGE, save the spec to `.feature-specs/{ISSUE_KEY}-{feature-name}/spec.md` with status `In Progress`.
- Read `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and the matching `bill-feature-implement-agentic` section in `.agents/skill-overrides.md` when present.
- Discover codebase patterns: similar features referenced in the spec, build/runtime dependencies for affected boundaries, reusable components.
- Confirm `bill-quality-check` can route this repo; if not, pick a repo-native validation command.
- If the rollout uses a feature flag, read `bill-feature-guard` inline and choose a pattern (Legacy / DI Switch / Simple Conditional).

The subagent returns the **pre-planning return contract** (see reference.md). The orchestrator keeps this digest in context and passes it to later subagents — the raw findings stay in the subagent.

## Step 3: Create Implementation Plan (subagent)

Spawn a subagent with the planning briefing defined in [reference.md](reference.md) under "Planning subagent briefing". The briefing includes: acceptance criteria, non-goals, feature size, pre-planning digest (from Step 2), rollout info, feature-flag pattern (if any), and validation strategy.

The subagent returns the **planning return contract**: an ordered task list, each task with description, files to create/modify, which acceptance criteria it satisfies, and test coverage (or `None` when deferred to the final test task). For MEDIUM/LARGE with >15 tasks, the plan must be split into phases with checkpoints.

If the plan includes testable logic, the **final task must be a dedicated test task**. The subagent is responsible for enforcing this rule in the plan it returns.

The orchestrator presents the plan, then proceeds to implementation — the plan is not a second approval gate.

## Step 4: Execute Plan (subagent)

Spawn a subagent with the implementation briefing defined in [reference.md](reference.md) under "Implementation subagent briefing". The briefing includes: acceptance criteria, plan (from Step 3), pre-planning digest (from Step 2), rollout info, feature-flag pattern (if any), spec path (for MEDIUM/LARGE), and execution rules (project standards, test gate, orphan cleanup, catalog updates for agent-config changes).

The subagent executes the plan atomically (one task per turn), prints per-task progress, writes tests as specified, and stops to re-plan if a task reveals the plan is wrong. On stop-and-re-plan, the subagent returns with `plan_deviation_notes` populated so the orchestrator can decide whether to re-spawn the planning subagent.

The subagent returns the **implementation return contract**: `files_created`, `files_modified`, `tasks_completed`, `plan_deviation_notes`, `tests_written`, `notes_for_review`.

For MEDIUM/LARGE, the subagent performs the **post-implementation compact** internally before returning: summarize files, feature flag info, criteria-to-file mapping, deviations; then re-read the saved spec to verify every criterion is mapped.

## Step 5: Code Review (orchestrator)

Run `bill-code-review` **inline in the orchestrator** (read its skill file and apply inline). Scope: current unit of work for SMALL, branch diff for MEDIUM/LARGE. Do not wrap `bill-code-review` in an additional subagent — it already spawns specialist subagents internally.

**Review loop:** Auto-fix Blocker and Major findings by spawning the implementation subagent again with a fix briefing (acceptance criteria + list of findings + pointer to the current diff + instruction to fix only those findings). Before respawning, capture the exact diff pointer the review was run against — the branch name, commit range (e.g. `main..HEAD`), or explicit file list — and pass it as `{branch_or_commit_range}` in the fix briefing so the subagent knows which diff "the findings" refer to. Re-run review. Continue past Minor-only findings. Max **3 iterations**. Do not pause to ask the user which finding to fix.

**Orchestrated child telemetry:** when this workflow invokes `import_review` and `triage_findings` for the review it owns, pass `orchestrated=true` to both tools. Collect the `telemetry_payload` returned by `triage_findings` (or by `import_review` when the review has no findings) and append it to the local `child_steps` list. The review will not emit `skillbill_review_finished` on its own — its payload will be embedded in the `skillbill_feature_implement_finished` event instead.

## Step 6: Completeness Audit (subagent)

Spawn a subagent with the audit briefing defined in [reference.md](reference.md) under "Completeness audit subagent briefing". The briefing includes: acceptance criteria, implementation return contract (from Step 4), and — for MEDIUM/LARGE — a pointer to the branch diff.

**SMALL:** the subagent returns a quick confirmation for each criterion.
**MEDIUM/LARGE:** the subagent returns a full per-criterion report with evidence paths.

The subagent returns the **audit return contract**: `pass: bool`, `per_criterion: [...]`, `gaps: [...]`.

If gaps found: the orchestrator respawns the planning subagent with the gaps, then the implementation subagent, then re-runs code review, then re-spawns the audit subagent. Max **2 audit iterations**. When complete, the orchestrator updates the saved spec status to **Complete** (MEDIUM/LARGE only).

## Finalization sequence (Steps 6b → 9)

Once the audit passes, run Steps 6b through 9 as a **continuous sequence without pausing**. The only reason to stop is if a step fails.

### Step 6b: Final Validation Gate (subagent)

Spawn a subagent with the quality-check briefing defined in [reference.md](reference.md) under "Quality-check subagent briefing". The subagent runs `bill-quality-check` (which auto-routes to the matching stack quality-check skill), fixes any issues at their root without using suppressions, and **must call `quality_check_finished` with `orchestrated=true`** itself. The subagent returns: `validation_result`, `routed_skill`, `detected_stack`, `initial_failure_count`, `final_failure_count`, and the `telemetry_payload` returned by `quality_check_finished`.

If `bill-quality-check` reports no supported stack for the affected repo, the subagent falls back to the closest existing repo-native validation command.

The orchestrator appends the returned `telemetry_payload` to the `child_steps` list.

### Step 7: Write Boundary History (orchestrator)

Run `bill-boundary-history` inline in the orchestrator (read its skill file and apply inline). The skill owns write/skip rules and entry format.

### Step 8: Commit and Push (orchestrator)

1. Stage all new and modified files from this feature (do not use `git add -A`)
2. Commit with message format: `feat: <concise description>` (omit the issue key — the branch name already carries it)
3. Push the branch to the remote with `-u` to set upstream tracking

### Step 9: Generate PR Description (subagent)

Spawn a subagent with the PR-description briefing defined in [reference.md](reference.md) under "PR-description subagent briefing". The subagent runs `bill-pr-description` (read its skill file and apply inline), creates the PR, and **must call `pr_description_generated` with `orchestrated=true`** itself. The subagent returns: PR URL, PR title, and the `telemetry_payload` returned by `pr_description_generated`.

The orchestrator appends the returned `telemetry_payload` to the `child_steps` list.

### Telemetry: Record Finished

For the shared telemetry contract including orchestrated flag semantics, child step collection, and graceful-degradation rules, follow [telemetry-contract.md](telemetry-contract.md).

After the PR is created (or when the workflow ends early due to error or user abandonment), call the `feature_implement_finished` MCP tool with:
- `session_id`: from `feature_implement_started`
- `completion_status`: `completed` if PR was created, otherwise `abandoned_at_planning`, `abandoned_at_implementation`, `abandoned_at_review`, or `error`
- `plan_correction_count`: how many times the user corrected the assessment or plan (0 if confirmed without changes)
- `plan_task_count`, `plan_phase_count`
- `feature_flag_used`, `feature_flag_pattern` (`simple_conditional`, `di_switch`, `legacy`, or `none`)
- `files_created`, `files_modified`, `tasks_completed`
- `review_iterations`, `audit_result` (`all_pass`, `had_gaps`, or `skipped`), `audit_iterations`
- `validation_result` (`pass`, `fail`, or `skipped`), `boundary_history_written`, `pr_created`
- `boundary_history_value`: how useful the boundary history was during pre-planning (`none` if no history existed, `irrelevant`, `low`, `medium`, or `high`)
- `plan_deviation_notes`: brief note if the plan changed during execution (empty if no deviations)
- `child_steps`: list of `telemetry_payload` dicts collected from child tools invoked with `orchestrated=true` during the session

For fields not yet reached (early exit), use: 0 for counts, `skipped` for results, false for booleans.
